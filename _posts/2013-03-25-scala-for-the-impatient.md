* Getting started quickly with Scala’s interpreter, syntax, tools, and unique idioms

* Mastering core language features: functions, arrays, maps, tuples, packages, imports, exception handling, and more

* Becoming familiar with object-oriented programming in Scala: classes, inheritance, and traits

* Using Scala for real-world programming tasks: working with files, regular expressions, and XML

* Working with higher-order functions and the powerful Scala collections library

* Leveraging Scala’s powerful pattern matching and case classes

* Creating concurrent programs with Scala actors

* Implementing domain-specific languages

* Understanding the Scala type system

* Applying advanced “power tools” such as annotations, implicits, and delimited continuations 

<p style='text-align:justify; text-justify:inter-ideograph'>Scala is rapidly reaching a tipping point that will reshape the experience of programming. This book will help object-oriented programmers build on their existing skills, allowing them to immediately construct useful applications as they gradually master advanced programming techniques.</p>

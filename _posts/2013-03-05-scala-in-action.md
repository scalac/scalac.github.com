<p class='justify'>Scala in Action is a comprehensive tutorial that introduces Scala through clear explanations and numerous hands-on examples. Because Scala is a rich and deep language, it can be daunting to absorb all the new concepts at once. This book takes a "how-to" approach, explaining language concepts as you explore familiar programming challenges that you face in your day-to-day work.</p>

Scala 的学习曲线很陡，不过，学会之后，用起来应该很爽！

期待了三年的《[Scala in Action](http://manning.com/raychaudhuri/)》，三月会发布吗？

范例

```scala
object HelloWorld {
   def main(args: Array[String]) {
     println("Hello, world!")
   }
 }
 ```
或者

 {% highlight scala %}
  object HelloWorld extends App {
   println("Hello, world!")
 }
 {% endhighlight %}

附：

**Mac Shell javac 中文乱码**

在 MAC OS X 控制台下使用 javac 命令编译 Java 程序时，会出现乱码的情况，现提供一种解决办法：

打开终端( Terminal)窗口，点击桌面左上方的终端(Terminal) –> 偏好设置(Preferences) –> 设置 –> 高级 –> 字符编码 –> 简体中文(GB23112)。

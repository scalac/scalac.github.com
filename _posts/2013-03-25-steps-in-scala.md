title: "Steps in Scala"
description: "<p style='text-align:justify; text-justify:inter-ideograph'>Scala is a highly expressive, concise and scalable language. It is also the most prominent method of the new and exciting methodology known as object-functional programming. In this book, the authors show how Scala grows to the needs of the programmer, whether professional or hobbyist. They teach Scala with a step-by-step approach and explain how to exploit the full power of the industry-proven JVM technology. Readers can then dive into specially chosen design challenges and implementation problems, inspired by the trials of real-world software engineering.

Scala is a highly expressive, concise and scalable language. It is also the most prominent method of the new and exciting methodology known as object-functional programming. In this book, the authors show how Scala grows to the needs of the programmer, whether professional or hobbyist. They teach Scala with a step-by-step approach and explain how to exploit the full power of the industry-proven JVM technology. Readers can then dive into specially chosen design challenges and implementation problems, inspired by the trials of real-world software engineering. It also helps readers to embrace the power of static typing and automatic type inference. In addition, the book shows how to use the dual-object and functional-oriented natures combined at Scala's core, and so write code that is less 'boilerplate', giving a genuine increase in productivity.</p>
